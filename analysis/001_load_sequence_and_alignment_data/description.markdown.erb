## Load yeast gene and alignment data

This stage loads gene sequence and alignment data for *S.cerevisae* coding genes, and sequence alignments for orthologs for related yeast species. The gene sequence is data is from SGD. The multiple sequence alignment data is from [Wall *et al* 2005][wall]

### Data

There are <%= Gene.all.length %> protein coding genes in this data set. The data set was downloaded in fasta format from the [SGD ftp server][sgd]. The dataset was last modified on <%= File.stat("data/yeast_protein_genes.fasta.gz").mtime %>

In the multiple sequence alignment data set there are <%= Alignment.all.length %> alignments. There are <%= Alignment.count(:gene_count => 3) %> alignments with three species, and <%= Alignment.count(:gene_count => 4) %> alignments with four yeast species. The yeast species that are used in the alignments are *S. paradoxus*, *S. bayanus*, *S. mikatae*, *S. cerevisiae*.
