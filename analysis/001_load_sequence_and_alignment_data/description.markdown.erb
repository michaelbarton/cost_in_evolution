## Load yeast gene and alignment data

In this part of the research I need to organise a database for gene sequence and alignment data for *S.cerevisae* coding genes, and sequence alignments for orthologs for related yeast species. The gene sequence data was downloaded from SGD. The multiple sequence alignment data comes from the [Wall *et al* 2005][wall] article.

#### Protein coding genes

##### Table

The database table for genes contains columns for the SGD name of the sequence and the coding DNA. 

##### Validations

 * None of the table columns are empty
 * The sequence begins with a start codon, ends with a stop codon, and contains only ATGCs

##### Data

Each gene is loaded into the database from the SGD fasta file containing protein coding ORFs, and can be found on the [SGD ftp server][sgd]. This file was last modified on <%= File.stat("data/yeast_protein_genes.fasta.gz").mtime %>. The data is loaded into the database using the bioruby library, where for each fasta entry the first word of the header is stored as the gene name, and the fasta sequence is stored as the gene sequence.

After loading there are <%= Gene.all.length %> protein coding genes in the database. The smallest gene is <%= Gene.smallest_sequence_length %> nucleotides long including stop codon, the longest gene is <%= Gene.biggest_sequence_length %> nucleotides long including stop codon. The respective mean gene length and standard deviation is <%= Gene.mean_sequence_length %> and <%= Gene.standard_deviation_of_sequence_lengths %> nucleotides including stop codons.

#### Alignments

##### Table

The alignment table contains the multiple sequence alignments for yeast protein coding genes of 4 yeast species. This table has columns for the alignment text, the number of genes in the alignment and the length of the alignment. The table also maintains a foreign key association to the corresponding *S.cerevisiae* gene in the gene table.

##### Validations

 * No table columns are empty
 * The alignment contains a yeast gene his is done by testing that there is a SGD yeast gene name, prefixed by an _F_, the notation used in the multiple sequence alignment dataset from the [Wall 2005][wall] article.
 * The multiple sequence alignment header is not stored with the alignment text.
 * The multiple sequence alignment contains four yeast genes
 * The *S. cerevisiae* yeast gene sequence in the alignment matches that of the yeast gene sequence defined by SGD

#### Data

In the database there are <%= Alignment.all.length %> alignments. There are <%= Alignment.find_all_by_gene_count(3).length %> alignments with three species, and <%= Alignment.find_all_by_gene_count(4).length %> alignments with four yeast species. The yeast species that are used in the alignments are *S. paradoxus*, *S. bayanus*, *S. mikatae*, *S. cerevisiae*. The original alignments, as described in the wall paper, were aligned using clustalw, using amino acid sequences as a template for the nucleotide alignments.

The longest alignment is <%= Alignment.biggest_length %> nucleotides including gaps and stop codons, the shortest alignment is <%= Alignment.smallest_length %> nucleotides includings gaps and stop codons. The respective mean and standard deviations of alignment length are <%= Alignment.mean_length %> and <%= Alignment.standard_deviation_of_lengths %>.
