# Estimating sitewise evolutionary rate in yeast protein sequences

This milestone aims to estimate the evolutionary rate of each position of a large subset of *S.cerevisiae* proteins. The evolutionary rate will be estimated by using the [codeml tool][paml] and four species multiple sequence alignment data from [Wall *et al* 2005][wall]

## Data

In the multiple sequence alignment data set there are <%= Alignment.all.length %> alignments. There are <%= Alignment.count(:gene_count => 3) %> alignments with three species, and <%= Alignment.count(:gene_count => 4) %> alignments with four yeast species. The yeast species that are used in the alignments are *S. paradoxus*, *S. bayanus*, *S. mikatae*, *S. cerevisiae*.
